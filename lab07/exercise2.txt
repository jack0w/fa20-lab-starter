Checkoff Question 1: In the innermost loop, we move through A, B, C with stride 1, 0, 1. It exploit spatial locality effectively
Checkoff Question 2: In the innermost loop, we move through A, B, C with stride 0, n, n. It doesn't exploit spacial locality
Checkoff Question 3: The smaller the strides of A,B,C in the innermost loop, the faster the performance is
