Mistake 1:
add t1, s0, x0      # load the address of the array of current node into t1

It actually load the address of current node into t1.

Fix:
lw t1, 0(s0)


Mistake 2:
add t1, t1, t0      # offset the array address by the count
lw a0, 0(t1)        # load the value at that address into a0

We need to multiply t0 by 4 and add 4 * t0 to t1 to affect the array address

Fix: 
slli t3, t0, 2
add t4, t3, t1
lw a0, 0(t4)


Mistake 3:
Need to save & load t0, t1, t2 before and after "jalr s1"

Fix:
addi sp, sp, -12
sw t0, 0(sp)
sw t1, 4(sp)
sw t2, 8(sp)

jalr s1

lw t0, 0(sp)
lw t1, 4(sp)
lw t2, 8(sp)
addi sp, sp, 12


Mistake 4:
la a0, 8(s0)        # load the address of the next node into a0

la is for loading the address of label

Fix:
lw a0, 8(s0)


Mistake 5:
 lw a1, 0(s1)        # put the address of the function back into a1 to prepare for the recursion

This is loading the word of starting at address in s1

Fix:
mv a1, s1
